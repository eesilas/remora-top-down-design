# NVIDIA Orin Nano Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The cleaning robot control program in PR #2 was merged but contained no actual code changes. The optimization for NVIDIA Orin Nano needed to be redone, and a condition that halted execution needed to be identified and removed.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Halting Condition ✓
**Problem:** The `approach_wall()` function had a `while True:` loop that could run indefinitely if the sensor never reaches the target distance.

**Solution:** Added a `max_attempts` parameter (default: 100) to prevent infinite loops:
```python
def approach_wall(target_distance=0.1, max_attempts=100):
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        # ... sensor reading and movement logic
        attempts += 1
```

### 2. NVIDIA Orin Nano Compatibility ✓
**Problem:** Code used `RPi.GPIO` which is not compatible with NVIDIA Jetson/Orin platforms.

**Solution:** Added try/except block to import Jetson.GPIO with fallback to RPi.GPIO:
```python
try:
    import Jetson.GPIO as GPIO  # NVIDIA Orin Nano
except ImportError:
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Fallback for Raspberry Pi
```

### 3. Thread-Safe SPI Communication ✓
**Problem:** Multiple threads could access SPI bus concurrently, causing race conditions.

**Solution:** Added threading lock to ensure safe SPI access:
```python
import threading
spi_lock = threading.Lock()

def read_sensor_data():
    with spi_lock:
        response = spi.xfer2([0x01])
        # ...

def send_motor_command(direction, speed):
    with spi_lock:
        cmd = [0x02, direction, int(speed * 100)]
        spi.xfer2(cmd)
```

### 4. Performance Optimization ✓
**Problem:** Timing calculations were performed in every loop iteration.

**Solution:** Precomputed timing constants:
```python
SWIPE_TIME = SWIPE_DISTANCE / 0.5  # Time for horizontal swipe
STEP_TIME = STEP_DOWN / 0.3  # Time for vertical step
```

Then used these constants instead of calculating on each iteration:
```python
time.sleep(SWIPE_TIME)  # Instead of time.sleep(SWIPE_DISTANCE / 0.5)
time.sleep(STEP_TIME)   # Instead of time.sleep(STEP_DOWN / 0.3)
```

### 5. Project Cleanup ✓
Added `.gitignore` to exclude Python build artifacts like `__pycache__/`

## Testing
All optimizations were verified with a comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Precomputed constants are correct
- Thread-safe implementation works
- Max attempts logic prevents infinite loops
- All code changes are present in the file
- Code syntax is valid

## Impact
These changes ensure the cleaning robot will:
1. **Never hang indefinitely** - max_attempts prevents infinite loops
2. **Run efficiently on NVIDIA Orin Nano** - proper GPIO library and thread-safe operations
3. **Execute faster** - precomputed constants reduce runtime calculations
4. **Be more reliable** - thread-safe SPI prevents race conditions

## Files Modified
- `sub-carrier-main.py` - Main control program with all optimizations
- `.gitignore` - New file to exclude build artifacts
